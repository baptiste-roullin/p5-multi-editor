## p5


- Instance mode is designer for multiple sketches.
- Global mode is designed for a single sketch.
- With some hacks, we take the best of both worlds.

1. At launch and when using the left bar, a sketch file is imported
2. Every exported value in the file is injected in the global scope.
3. the `p5()` constructor is called. This constructor picks these two function and execute them.
